### Permissions:

If you do not want the bot to delete the messages for things like emoji commands, simply deny `Manage Messages` permission for the bot. You need to provide the required permissions for each moderation command you want to use. For example `Ban Members` to ban members, `Kick Members` to kick members, etc.
